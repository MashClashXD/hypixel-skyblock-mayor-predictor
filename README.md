# hypixel-skyblock-mayor-predictor
Random Forest and SVM model that predicts the winner of the Hypixel Skyblock Election.

Scraped data from [here]([url](https://hypixel-skyblock.fandom.com/wiki/Module:Mayor/Elections/ApiData?action=edit)) and [here]([url](https://hypixel-skyblock.fandom.com/wiki/Module:Mayor/Elections/Data?action=edit)).

Lacks Minister perk data so it can never be extremely accurate as they play a large role in voting behaviour. If you have minister perks (ie. which perk was the minister perk for each candidate per election) please contact me!
